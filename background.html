This project is very important since it can improve the cleanliness and hygiene of the people of the 
Badjao community. This is key because as we have seen the community has struggled with many 
issues including their hygiene and trash disposal methods, and our project can help them improve 
on these skills significantly and help their homes be much safe and cleaner for life to flourish, by assisting 
them in learning methods such as clay-go or implementing the use of bins for specific types of waste, which 
will not only make things easier to organize, but some of the organized garbage can be recycled and made anew.

<p>
As said by the residents, trash that is spreading around the community were from
 the ocean and sometimes because of floods. Since they're living near the ocean, 
it is expected that there would be water/unnecessary things coming their way such 
as trash like plastic bags, pet bottles, wrappers, and so forth. Sometimes, it's the flood 
that brings and leaves trash in the community. This issue is really important and needs 
to be taken action. Due to the fact that cleanliness is important especially in a community 
wherein a lot of people stay and most of them are prone to diseases. We suggest that we 
should be more responsible with our trash, not only the people living in their community 
but also those people who are careless with their own garbage. Cleanliness also helps reduce 
pollution, protects endangered species, and preserves our natural resources. That's why this is 
part of our mission/goal because we know how hard it is for them to encounter such problems 
and we know that it'll become a havoc to them, especially with their health. As an ecotenean, it 
is also our pleasure to help others regarding problems like this. It is also a big contribution to our 
mother nature, for we have been causing the same troubles throughout.</p>
