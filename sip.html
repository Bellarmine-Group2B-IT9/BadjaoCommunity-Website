<h2 id ="sitename"> What is compost </h2>
<p>
Compost is a fertilizer that uses waste or other ingredients to make soil that will <br>
improve its physical, chemical, and biological properties. Because compost contains plant <br>
nutrients from the ingredients that were put into the soil, these ingredients are mostly <br>
made up of fruit peels that are decomposed by bacteria that convert the peels into carbon <br>
and ammonium that will support the plants growth.And another benefit of composting is that <br>
it uses organic materials instead of artificial fertilizers and chemicals that could hinder the plants<br>

<h2 id ="sitename"> What plant will your group focus on </h2>
<p>
Banana peels carry calcium, magnesium, sulfur, phosphorus, and potassium. These nutrients promote <br>
root growth, helps add oxygen to your soil, repel pests, improves fruiting and flowering, improves <br>
general plant vigor; building resistance to pests and diseases, and assists photosynthesis, pollination, <br>
viability, and fruit development. In conclusion, banana peels are full of nutrients and good for our plants. <br>
Tomatoes are mostly in need of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, potash, calcium, and magnesium, along with <br>
other trace minerals. Speaking, banana peels are really good for plants because it also contains nitrogen. <br>
Banana peels also prevents blossom end rot in tomatoes which really happens often. That's why tomatoes are <br>
perfect for a lot of plants, such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and even radishes.<br>
</p>

<div id="type">
<h2 id ="sitename"> What type of compost </h2>
<p>The type of compost that will be able to provide the necessary nutrients for the tomato <br>
plant is compost made from banana peels. When we use this method of composting, <br>
the soil absorbs nutrients and passes them on to the tomato plant. Banana peel fertilizer <br>
is high in potassium and magnesium, which help to strengthen stem and plant root growth <br>
and improve nutrient distribution. You can compost banana peels, sow them directly into the <br>
soil near the plants, or ferment banana peels in water and then apply the water to the soil with a spray bottle.<br>
<br>
<p>This is the composting process and starting material that could provide these nutrients. You can <br>
add banana peels to a compost pile and use the compost to increase the organic material content of the <br>
soil and fertilize your plants by cutting the banana peels into one inch strips or small pieces, then laying <br>
them on top of the soil or working them into the potting soil.<br>
<br>
<p>Yes, banana peels can be used as fertilizer and will not harm your plants; however, it is best to compost <br>
them first. Burying banana peels in soil beneath a plant can slow the process of breaking down the peels and <br>
releasing their nutrients to the plant. This process requires air, and buried banana peels degrade much more <br>
slowly than those placed in a properly maintained compost pile that is regularly turned and aerated.<br>

<div id="benefit">
<h2 id ="sitename"> How would the compost provivide benefit to your plant </h2>
<p>Plants use their leaves to convert food into organic matter after absorbing it through their roots. <br>
Small absorbing hairs are tightly connected to soil particles at the root level. These hairs are superior. <br>
The area where the plant and soil come into contact improves the ability of the root surface to absorb <br>
water. Plant food ascends from the roots to the leaves. As a result of the processes of evaporation and <br>
transpiration. During the day, the sap in the leaves increases.<br>
</p>

<div id="effective">
<h2 id ="sitename"> What is an effective ways to use the compost </h2>
<p>1-2 inches of compost should be worked into the top 3-5 inches of soil. In the fall, add plenty of 
compost to your vegetable garden. Spread several inches of compost on top of the existing bed in the 
spring, then till it into the soil. When planting, place a handful of compost in each hole. You can add a 
half-inch layer of compost around the base of the plants once they start growing quickly. Monthly apply 
1/2 inch of compost to "heavy feeder" plants like tomatoes, corn, and squash; this will result in abundant produce!
